# What I learnt from using a Physical Zettelkasten

1. Create an [[Index Card]] ASAP

2. **Separate Notebox**(Vault) for two *drastically* different projects - such as a personal organizer and notes on economic research(*to dos of research can go into research dailies*)

3. **Date based UUIDs** are  extremely important/convenient for a physical zettelkasten - It offers minimum cognitive load. They are useful for *information retrieval*.
 
> Still a good practice for Digital Zettelkasten, but not for information retrieval purposes(for example - duplicate filenames)

4. A **workspace of notes** currently worked upon - *including [[Fleeting Notes]] conversion to [[Zettels]] on the spot.*

5. It is imperative to **not think too much.** Remember, *getting out the idea is critical*. Notes can always be tended to later. 

> A bad working zettel is better than a formatted fleeting note!

6. From above - **Just start!** There is too much emphasis on a zettel's signal to noise ratio but *anything written in your own words is your idea and it is enough*. The idea matters, not the form. **The print ready form of a zettel should only be its final version**, which can always be done digitally. Ideas can escape quickly and focus should be on them. *The only criteria is that the future you should understand them*, and I reckon one most probably will - **No jargons!**

7. Say you have an idea 
	1. Have a clock on you and create a note with the UUID and topic name.
	2.  Jot down the idea and add tags and any immediate links you can think of. 
	3.  Backlink to Index Note and Add an entry link to the index note
	4.  O*f course digitally - backlinks, UUIDs, tags(after a period of time) are automatically generated*

8.  ==Use **extremely inefficient/Poor cards**  as Fleeting Notes. ==*(Again irrelevant digitally)*

9.  ==Fleeting Notes can be directly converted into Zettels. Keep the Literature Notes for the Note-taking sessions.==

10.  **Literature Notes** should be written strictly in an **outliner style**. Take an A4 sheet and make bullet points. Digitally, *you can use Dynalist*(or any other outliner software) for the note-taking and then export them to Obsidian through a script or the in-built export function. 

11.  Append UUID of continuation notes alphabetically. If it takes two cards for one topic the first one is UUID-A Title and second UUID-B Title where UUID is the same time. Do not create a separate UUID for the continuation note. This is again digitally irrelevant since it is mainly useful for information retrieval.

12.  **Have a strict word limit**. With my writing on both sides of a card I manage about 150 words. Keep that limit digitally also(though somewhat loosely) - *I recommend the papercut plugin i*n Obsidian. Remember, it's **one idea per zettel.**

13.  **The Daily Notes folder** in Obsidian *will serve both as your Fleeting Note repository as well as your to do list. Tag and mark the to do header section as a template.*  If a task *'Write an essay on Obsidian'* you can later move it into your Projects zettel under your My Life index note. 

14.  ==Thus zettels work for organization and not notes only!==

15.  *You will realize how important two way linking is* and will never take for granted the fact that the app does it for you. **Be grateful!**

> Finally you will learn really what an OG Luhmann was. The guy created a physical zettelkasten of 90,000 notes! Just managing hundreds of index cards required crazy focus and care not to miss a backlink here or there. He really was the real deal.

### Extremely useful plugins in Obsidian in my opinion are
- Core plugins - They do 90 percent of the work
- Sliding Panes
- Kanban
- Collapse all - This little boy should be a core IMHO
- What you cannot do without anyway(YMMV)
	- Git
	- Slated
	- PDF to Markdown : I just convert a pdf to a note and make a literature note out of it
	- Note refactor
	- Prettifier 
	- Advanced Tables

Don't over-complicate Obsidian and focus on the note taking. You don't need Obsidian to be a Notion. Dataview and Templater are powerful but only for those who know what they're doing. 

Zettelkasten really works! The physical way will make you feel that Obsidian is childs play. You don't need every new plugin. Beyond a few, more plugins are detrimental to your productivity. Keep it simple. Focus on the Note-taking!
