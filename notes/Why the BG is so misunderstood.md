# Why the BG is so misunderstood

***  
  
 
The BG although being a primary sacred text for Hindus is not the *holy book* as compared to the Koran or Bible. It is considered as *smriti* or a secondary text for a crude analogy whereas the core philosophy of Hinduism is *shruti* i.e primary text or the direct revelation through the mystical experience or the Perennial philosophy - which are the Vedas and specifically the Philosophy of Vedas which one can say is an appendix to each of the four Vedas - called Vedanta (End of Veda) or as we popularly know them - *The Upanishads*. The upanishads are meant for sacred teachings for the select whereas The BG is a *Vedanta for the masses* i.e a semi philosophical summary of the key ideas of upanishads (there are about 108 of them).

  

To understand the BG completely one needs to know about the context, i.e the story of the mahabharata through which we find out why exactly Arjuna **needs** to battle. Arjuna is the protagonist hero of the story and if he gives up his arms, the Kauravas (the enemy of his own kinsmen) will certainly win the battle. Krishna is an avatar of Vishnu, the logos of order, and the victory of the Pandavas is crucial to prevent chaos and adharma (righteousness). Of course chaos and order are two sides of the same coin, and Shiva(the logos of creative destruction) acts by destroying the universe after the end of each yuga(a cycle of universe)

  

The story touches the deep ambiguity of the western philosophical paradox of whether a command by God is good because it is from God or because God is good? That is does rationality have the authority to reject God. If so then it's not God because it is superseded. (think of abraham and Isaac) - Krishna is not the anthropomorphic creator God western people would see it by. It is not like Zeus or even Jesus. That is because while westerners think of Hinduism as polytheistic, in fact it is not even monotheistic but monistic.

  

> *tat tvam asi* - thou art that.

  

Everything is Brahman(the absolute) . The ground of Being. Everything is atman(the self- not ego but the transcendent 'I') which is the canvas in which physics, Psychology and even reality are projections. Atman = Brahman is the core of vedanta thought. **The self is the absolute.**

  

Now the BG is allegorical. All religions are metaphorical. Krishna represents pure consciousness. That is why he is arjunas charioteer. Arjuna as you can guess is the ego. The Kauravas symbolize sense pleasures and attachments - some which are very dear to us - attachment to your parent for example. The Pandavas (who are five) represent the 5 qualities one needs to reach Krishna, with the ego as the protagonist. Thus Arjuna is God, but an unrealized one. That is why Krishna says

  

> you and I have been reborn countless times . I remember them all but you do not.

  

Pure consciousness is the domain of both heaven and hell. The will of the absolute is but one. It is this

  

> to realize itself.

  

Think of it as we are the universe experiencing itself. As Walt Whitman says in LoGrass- *Every atom of me as good belongs to you.*

  

Thus the Self (Krishna) has a goal of preservation. But there is a deeper goal, it is that of realizing itself. It is through destruction of attachment and desires (the Kauravas) one is able to even start towards merging with Krishna. Thus the determinism of Krishna for the only way of achieving the cosmic goal of cosmic consciousness is sacrifice. With understanding, action becomes inaction because you don't doubt.

  

But without understanding action can be guided through dharma(duty) which will eventually lead to understanding. For the masses who don't have the time for philosophical reflection, their best bet is to first detach themselves from all desires, and do actions which are primed towards a certain *telos*(finality).

  

Also at the end of Mahabharata, which one can say allegorically is the end of human life. All but one of the 5 pandavas (the 5 qualities for transcending) die, including arjuna, who dies second to last - allegorical of ego death. The only one that remains is Yudhisthara, the eldest and the personification of Dharma, who alone goes to the heaven beyond heaven. And that is the meaning of existence. Staying true to his dharma, yudhishthira merges with Brahman. That is to say

  

> when one actually realizes and not just knows the meaning of life, which is to find the Krishna within, is the be all and end all of life.

  

The syllable 'aum' represents 4 stages of consciousness within the Self.

  

1. A - the outward ego

2. U - The inward ego

3. M - The causal ego (or who you are when you're in deep sleep, the body breathes itself, that you is more real than the waking you)

4. The transcendent ego - it is the medium in which aum manifests. The silence before and after and within it like a canvas. Sound is vibrating air. Silence is still air. The cosmic air is the absolute.
