# Philosophy of Note taking - Principles of Note taking

## What is a **Note**?

We treat notes as records of ideas and facts. But that is the approach of an archivist! Are notes meant to be just a medium of information storage, or could they be more?

It is the question which Marshall Mc Luhan approached in [[The Medium is the Message]] as how the development of writing in human history moulded our cognition as opposed to the oral tradition. I am a faithful adherent of the ideology that writing transforms thinking
- Writing is itself thinking
- Writing allows us to structure and organize our thoughts
- All information is useful if only it is expressed and expressed correctly

Thus, notes are not for the archivist, but thoughts expressed in the most conscious and deliberate - i.e. hardest way possible. Indeed, the now famous Feynman Method proposes the fundamental principle of note-taking!

> Take a blank sheet and a pen and express a concept as if teaching to a layperson. If you cannot do so, you haven't understood it!

### Principles of Note-taking
- Should express at least a single idea which is
	- Non-trivial i.e. carries with it actual insight and no superfluous or redundant concepts. See [[Information Theory - entropy]]

> A note which contains the definition of a concept is not a note strictly, perhaps weakly. Since it is just a mass of information as fact and contains no idea, direct or indirect. It is not a note.

- Should be context independent and fully understandable in itself, by itself. That is, some layperson reading even a single note should not require further context for at least understanding that note's primary idea. 

> Thus that note's place within the literature should be expressed in the note.

- The note should have **NO COPY-PASTING**

> Copy pasting a note doesn't make it your own. Neither do you understand it, the idea it carries and most probably, you'll forget about it in the mass of copy-pasted notes you already have. Notes need intimacy. Write your own notes, as succintly as possible.

- Standardized. Fix a template to your note-taking and be consistent with it.

- The note's information must be retrievable immediately. Write in long form instead of outlines. Outlines are good for organizing, but not for future learning and writing. Reading outlines is just a form of *cramming*. Make short notes of 300-700 words per concept.
