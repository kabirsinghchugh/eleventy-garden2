## On Death

When the Sage died, his closest friend, the old-master came, smiled a radiant smile to his dead body and left. The disciple of the Sage asked, 'You're not his friend, for you mourn not!' . The old-master replied, 'I mourn as I rejoice', 'I first thought you were followers of his teaching, but I was mistaken.' 'What I see here are people wailing, shedding buckets of tears, and giving eloquent eulogies and condolences. Nobody begged them for it, certainly not the dead sage. If they really were disciples of the Sage, they would know that'  **The Sage came, knowing his season. When it went, he followed.He is now where he is supposed to go. Where he has gone is beyond joy or sorrows. In the old days we used to call it being __free from bondage__.**
