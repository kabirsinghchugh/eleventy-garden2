# When I was High
      
This Monday I smoked weed with Karan. It was a nice day overall. Lets recap it phenomenologically

  

### The Evening

  

- I started off taking moda and caffeine and met Karan at 7 pm 
- We went to buy beer - two druks
- Came to terrace , climbed up, drank the beer and made the roll
- climbed down the ladder
- smoked
- The high began - I as usual became existential
- Derealization? Depersonalization?
- Climbed down and went to the park, had a quick round - saw people playing badminton, loved the nature walk and greenery of plants
- went back and sat in his car, stopped to buy limca and elaichi
- talked about social dilemma, came home
- had dinner, had a talk with mum about relatives
- started talking about marriage, and mom opened up on her experience
- talked about the benefit of today
- came up while talking
- felt closer
- slept
